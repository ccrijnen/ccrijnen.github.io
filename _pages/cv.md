## Master Thesis

* **Title:** *Visual Enhancement of Whole Brain Slide Images from Z-Scanning Microscopes with Deep Style Learning*
* **Supervisors:** Timo Dickscheid & Stefan Harmeling
* **Description:** Developed the Z-Stack Enhancement (ZSE) pipeline, a framework for improving the visual quality and reducing blurring of z-stack brain images from whole slide microscopy scanners. The deep style learning-based method was trained on a large dataset of microscopic images to transfer the style of a selected in-focus reference image to out-of-focus microscopic images, resulting in improved visual appearance and aiding researchers in identifying individual cells and other structures.

## Bachelor Thesis

* **Title:** *Playing Go with Recurrent Neural Networks*
* **Supervisors:** Stefan Harmeling & Michael Leuschel
* **Description:** Investigated the effectiveness of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in playing the game of Go using imitation learning. Compared results with DeepMind’s AlphaGo to analyze how different architectures influence performance.
